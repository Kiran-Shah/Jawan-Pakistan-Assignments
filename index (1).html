    <h1><b>Why to boycott Israel Products</b></h1>
    <p>Israel has killed over <b>21,000</b>  <i>Palestinians</i>  since October 7, 2023. This includes a huge number of children and women. Most of the people killed in this war are civilians, including journalists. Israel blames Hamas for its recent <strong>genocide</strong> in the Gaza Strip. However, many, including UN Secretary-General <abbr title="Mister">Mr</abbr> ,Antonio Guterres hold that the Hamas attacks did not happen in isolation, as they were the result of decades of oppression and occupation.</p>
<p>Israel’s technological advancement, its support by the <acronym title="United Nations">UN</acronym> and some other European nations, disharmony among the Muslim states, and its weak military strength have coerced the pro-Palestinian people to look for other means to stop Israel’s atrocities. Hence, the call for a <dfn>boycott</dfn> of pro-Israel and Israeli products has become an effective way to protest against Israel’s massacre in Palestinian land. </p>
<p><q>This Palestinian movement has enlisted numerous pro-Israel products that Muslim nations should boycott to support Palestine</q>. Although the divestment campaign against Israeli companies has been labeled anti-Semitic by sympathizers of Israel, a host of famous personalities, including celebrities, have joined it. Amidst this new wave of Israeli Israeli violations of international law in the Gaza war, the <dfn>BDS</dfn> movement has resurfaced. People around the world are boycotting the brands that, directly or indirectly, are supporting Israel in its genocidal campaign in Gaza. This boycott of Israeli products has resulted in colossal losses for many of these brands.</p>
<p>As per reports, Starbucks has faced a huge loss of more than $11 billion due to this boycott. Furthermore, reports suggest that Starbucks and H&M would permanently close their businesses in Morocco by the end of 2023 due to the losses followed by the prevailing economic boycott. The Israeli boycott campaign is gaining momentum with time, putting pressure on Israel for its human rights violations. People in Pakistan have also shunned Israeli and international companies in the wake of the BDS movement.<br/> McDonald’s, Nestlé, Pepsi, Fiverr, and Amazon are among the most well-known pro-Israel brands and companies in Pakistan.</p>
<p>McDonald’s Pakistan has experienced the most serious blowback due to this boycott. The effect of McDonald’s boycott could be gauged by the fact that it has lowered its prices by up to 60 percent to maintain its sales in the country. However, the BDS movement has sparked a new debate among citizens about whether international brands that show support for Israel should be boycotted or not.</p>
